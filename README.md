`ELMS - Electronic Location Monitoring System`


`ELMS` is both an application written entirely in C/C++ and a React App. It takes in GPS data from giant mining vehicles and processes it. In doing so it has two effects: updating a database for viewing vehicles and their statuses as well as sending messages via the serial port to vehicles that are in danger.
